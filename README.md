# episerver-9-block-types
In this repository we are going to focus on developing blocks and block types in Episerver CMS. 

Before we dive in on the blocks and block types I would like to give a short summary to why episerver cms is so popular and why you should use it.

By working with blocks in episerver you create content once and can then reuse it on as many pages you want, its a very easy and effecient way to maintain a bigger website with hundreds or even thousand of pages with alot of content that is common.

In this course we are going to focus on blocks and block types that where introduced with Episerver CMS version seven. Blocks are similar to pages but a block is specifically intended to only be used as part of a page and can be reused on different pages all over your website. 

What is a block type?

Think of blocks as a group of properties. 

Have a look at the picture to the left: Here we have a example of a block we are going to creat later in our demo. It has a header, description, image and a button with a URL attached to it. 

All blocks are also “shared blocks”. Once you create a block you can reuse it on other pages. You often have content that you want to reuse on other pages, block types is the perfect solution to create reusable content.
